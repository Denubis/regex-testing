# regex-testing

# AIM of this exercise:

1. Create one folder for each site labelled by the three to four digits. The site digits are in the begining of the image names, followed by underscore.
2. Move all images to their corresponding site folder.

# Progress:
So far I was able to create folders, but I can't figure out how to move the images into them. 
See the bash script ```makeFold.sh``` in the folder ```images```.
