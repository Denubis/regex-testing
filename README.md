# AIM of this exercise:

I have several .jpg images in the folder ```images``` and I need to create new subfolders based on the names of the images and distribute the images to their respective folders. I want to do it by using terminal, not manually.

I need to do the following steps:

1. Create one folder for each site labelled by the three to four digits. The site digits are in the begining of the image names, followed by underscore.
2. Select and move all images to their corresponding site folder.

# Progress:
So far I was able to create folders, but I can't figure out how to move the images into them. 
See the bash script ```makeFold.sh``` in the folder ```images```.
